# 🔍 Real-Time Anomaly Detection in Machine Temperature Data

This project detects anomalies in machine temperature sensor data using **Isolation Forest** and **One-Class SVM** algorithms. It uses a dataset from the Numenta Anomaly Benchmark (NAB).

## 📊 Project Goal

To build a real-time anomaly detection system that flags unusual machine temperature values — useful for predictive maintenance in industries.

## 📁 Dataset

- **Source**: [NAB Dataset - machine_temperature_system_failure.csv](https://github.com/numenta/NAB)
- Contains timestamps and temperature readings of an industrial machine.
- The data includes both normal and abnormal behavior.
